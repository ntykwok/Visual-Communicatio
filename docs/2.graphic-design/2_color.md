# Color Theory
Design theory is a system that helps us better understand how we can **communicate a message to audiences through visuals**. It involves identifying the different **elements in an image** and explaining **why they're important**.

:::tip Highlight
Visual Communication is an ever-changing field, and thus, it never gets boring (but that’s subjective, of course).

## Color Properties

<code>Color</code> has three primary qualities, known as properties: 

**hue** , **value** and **intensity**.  Each property affects the way we perceive color. Understanding these concepts will help you create and effectively apply color palettes in your designs.

-**Hue** refers to a color in its pure state. It also denotes a color’s position on the color wheel.

-**Value** describes the degree of lightness or darkness in color. There are three ways to change the value of a color: tinting lightens the color by adding white, toning softens a color by adding gray and shading darkens a color by adding black.

-**Intensity** is the brightness or dullness of a color based on saturation. A color is most intense in its purest form (hue). Intensity is low when a color is mixed with a complementary color or a neutral color.

## Hard Skills

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Soft Skills



Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
